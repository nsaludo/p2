## Description

This is the second project for the Dynamic Web application class. A password generator that generates password based on common english words which is inspired by the comic strip in http://xkcd.xom/936.  The comic strip suggests that random common words are better passwords than uncommon words because they are easier to remember but still difficult for others to guess.  The project requires a server side code written in php that will validate parameters sent and successfully generate passwords and display errors if there are invalid parameters.
